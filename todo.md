- [ ] only use `bld_string` interally instead of raw strings
- [x] add linker as a concept to the system
- [ ] rebuild with less restrictive flags
- [x] write project with c89
- [x] allow using compiler different from default in linking step
- [ ] handle project with .so files
- [ ] allow setting compiler for all files under directory
- [ ] represent project files as tree
- [x] figure out how to handle special cases for the rebuilder
- [ ] remove tiny mallocs from set
- [x] add prototypes to private functions
- [ ] add documentation to functions
- [x] join graph with containers if possible
- [ ] handle failed parse
- [x] rename functions into a consistent style
- [x] hide compilation (incremental/from scratch) behind single function
- [x] replace wrappers to generic array and set by array/set
- [x] avoid recompiling file twice when performing incremental compilation
- [ ] add functions to analyze the dependency graph
- [x] parse symbols that are variables ("B" entries when running nm)
- [ ] expose api to generate human-readable dependency graph
- [ ] collapse array when only serializing 0 or 1 element/s
- [ ] find build directory automatically by searching upwards for cbuild and verify that correct files are present
- [x] use prefix on functions to avoid collisions
- [x] handle forward declarations of compiler associated with file
- [x] keep file id in node instead of pointer to file (pointer might become invalid, id never becomes invalid)
- [x] handle case where cache exists but .o file is missing
- [x] separate file and graph data in serialized cache
- [x] move compilation of project to different file
- [x] move functions and includes to `bld_file` keep edges in `bld_node`
- [x] handle failed compilation
- [ ] make sure no path separator is passed when removing file ending
- [x] use realloc instead of memcpy and free
- [x] move value size from function call to generic container struct
- [ ] extract exposed functions that can be used by the user
- [ ] define private function prototypes somewhere
- [ ] hide ubuntu dependencies in building behind interface
- [x] find include dependencies and put in graph
- [x] make graph optional (graph is now internal)
- [ ] make cache optional
- [x] recompile if file changed due to include dependency
- [x] use cache to populate graph
- [x] split generating dependency graph from indexing project
- [ ] detect when .c file was included and disregard when compiling
- [ ] detect if .h file is header only: unclear what it means for a file to be "header only"
- [x] remove duplication in growable arrays
- [ ] use hash maps where appropriate: hash maps do not seem to be needed, except perhaps for separating the parsing from the intepretation of the parsed data
- [ ] implement generic hash map
- [x] implement generic hash set for faster access
- [x] implement generic array to reduce code duplication
