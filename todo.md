[ ] find include dependencies and put in graph
[ ] make graph optional
[ ] make cache optional
[ ] recompile if file changed due to include dependency
[ ] use cache to populate graph
[ ] split generating dependency graph from indexing project
[ ] detect when .c file was included and disregard when compiling
[ ] detect if .h file is header only
[ ] use hash maps where appropriate
