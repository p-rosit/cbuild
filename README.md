# Philosophy

* Open world assumption
  * Introducing a new file/directory is not exceptional
  * Dependencies between files can change at any moment
* One project can produce several executables
* Setting up a project and building is easy
* Builds are frequent
* Projects are shared between computers in version control
* Testing is important
